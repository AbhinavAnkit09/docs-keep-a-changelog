# Folders

ImageKit.io's Media Library helps you efficiently upload and search files in folders.

### Create a Folder <a id="create-a-folder"></a>

Folders can be created only within the 'Directory View' of the Media Library. The 'Directory View' can be accessed at the lower right half of the Media Library \(right next to 'Image View'\)

Switch to 'Directory View' and click on 'Create Folder'.

A popup - 'Create New Folder' shows up, where you can enter the name of the folder you wish to create, and click on 'Create'.

The new folder is created, and you are now within your new folder.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The complete directory structure \(including the current folder\) can be viewed from the 'Directory View'. All folders in the directory structure act as links to the corresponding folders.
{% endhint %}

### Folder Search <a id="folder-search"></a>

Searching for a folder follows the same steps as a [file search](search-update-and-delete.md#file-search). You can enter the name of the folder you wish to search within the 'Search Bar' on top of the Media Library.

### Add Files to Folders <a id="add-files-to-folders"></a>

To add files to a particular folder, you need to open the folder first.

1. Find the folder to which you want to add the files. You can find the folder using the 'Search Bar', or by locating the folder within the 'Directory View'. Click on the folder to enter that folder.
2. You can now drag and drop images, or use the popup-based file selection to upload files to the selected folder.

In case you have any questions regarding adding files to the folder, please get in touch with our team at [support@imagekit.io](mailto:customer-support@imagekit.io).
