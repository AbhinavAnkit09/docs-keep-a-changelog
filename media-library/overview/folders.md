# Create folders

ImageKit.io's Media Library helps you efficiently upload and search files in folders.

### Create a Folder <a id="create-a-folder"></a>

Click on the New button on the top right corner and select New folder option. This will open a popup. Enter the folder name and click the submit. The new folder will be created in your current directory.

To create a folder in a specification directory, navigate to that directly, and create a folder there.

### Folder Search <a id="folder-search"></a>

Searching for a folder follows the same steps as a [file search](search-update-and-delete.md#file-search). You can enter the name of the folder you wish to search within the 'Search Bar' on top of the Media Library.

### Add Files to Folders <a id="add-files-to-folders"></a>

To add files to a particular folder, you need to open the folder first.

1. Find the folder to which you want to add the files. You can find the folder using the 'Search Bar', or by navigating to the folder.
2. You can now drag and drop images, or use the popup-based file selection to upload files to the selected folder.

In case you have any questions regarding adding files to the folder, please get in touch with our team at [support@imagekit.io](mailto:customer-support@imagekit.io).
