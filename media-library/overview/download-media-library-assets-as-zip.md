As soon as you click on "Download (as zip)" option, A dialog box appears that allows you to apply transformation on all the images in selected files and folders. All other files ( ex. videos, text files etc. ) are not modified. This could be useful for the marketing team allowing them to create a particular dimension variant for all images inside a folder.
