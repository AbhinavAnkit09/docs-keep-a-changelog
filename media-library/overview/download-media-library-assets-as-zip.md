# Download media library assets as a zip 

You can select and download multiple files, folders, and all of their contents, including any sub-folders as a single zip file. The downloaded zip maintains the original folder structure.

The maximum number of files and folders you can download is limited to 300.
Also, the total size of the files you can download is limited to 1 GB.
{% endhint %}

## How to start downloading?

Go to your media library on the Imagekit dashboard and select multiple files or folders using command + click ( for Mac users ). As soon as multiple files or folders are selected, the "Download (as zip)" option is available on the context menu.

As soon as you click on the "Download (as zip)" option, A dialog box appears that allows you to apply a transformation on all the images in selected files and folders. All other files (e.g., videos, text files,  etc. ) are not modified. This feature could be helpful for the marketing team, allowing them to create a particular dimension variant for all images inside a folder.

By clicking on "Submit", the zip generation begins. The status of download requests being processed appears in the bottom panel. Once the zip file is successfully generated, it automatically starts downloading.
You can navigate out of the media library and carry on with other tasks without waiting while your download requests are being processed. Later, you can go to the downloads section to download your zip files.

For visiting the downloads section, click on the "Downloads" in the panel at the bottom of your media library.

Here you can view the basic information about all your zip file downloads like name, creation time, file count, folder count of zip file up to the past seven days. You can search or sort based on name, time, etc. You can also download your zip file again using the link provided in the table.
