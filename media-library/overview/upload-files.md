# Upload files

Currently, you can upload images and static files to the media library in two ways - using the dashboard, and using the [upload API](../../api-reference/upload-file-api/). ImageKit.io currently supports [these formats for upload](../../api-reference/upload-file-api/#allowed-mime-types-for-uploading).

## Using Dashboard

Within the dashboard, navigate to 'Media Library' section

Click on the area below the 'Search' area marked as 'Drop files here or select files from your computer'. A popup opens on your screen.

Click on 'Select Files from Computer', which would open a computer system folder to select a file for upload. You can also select and upload multiple files at once, or upload an entire folder.

Once the files\(s\) or folder has been selected, the resources should start uploading and you should get an ImageKit.io's Image URL that can be used immediately.

ðŸ§™â™‚ **Tip:** Alternately, you can also drag and drop your files anywhere on the dashboard \(even when you are not in the Media Library section\) to upload your files as shown in the video below.

**Info:** When uploading images, ImageKit.io appends a random string to the image file name to avoid replacing images with the same file name. You can turn off this setting within the Upload Section of [Image Settings](https://imagekit.io/dashboard#settings) within the dashboard..
{% endhint %}

## Using the Upload API

You can also upload images to ImageKit.io's media library programmatically. Read the Upload API documentation [here](../../api-reference/upload-file-api/).
