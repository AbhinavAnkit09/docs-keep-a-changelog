# Image Tagging and searching

Image tagging is a good practice to sort and search images, as tags are additional attributes that can be attached to an image file.

For example: If you have a picture of a man wearing a t-shirt on your website, then you might want some additional attributes attached to the image, other than it's metadata, like:

1. Colour: Black
2. Collar: Round Neck
3. Sleeve: Short Sleeve
4. Material: Cotton
5. Print: Solid

This information might not be possibly reflected in the image name, and neither is it easy to organize the resources based on these attributes. Image Tags help with such day-to-day problems.

### Add image tags <a id="add-image-tags"></a>

You can either add image tags while [uploading the image](../../api-reference/upload-file-api/) or you can add tags from the ImageKit.io Media Library.

To add a tag to an image, right-click on the file to open the menu. Click on the "Tags" menu item. This will open a popup, enter the tags you want, and press the "Save" button.

You can select multiple files together by pressing and holding the Command key in Mac or the Ctrl key in Windows. Right-click on any file to open menu options. Select "Add Bulk Tags" or "Remove Bulk Tags" option. This will open a popup, enter the tag values, and press the "Save" button.

### Search with image tags <a id="search-with-image-tags"></a>

Click on the advanced icon right next to the text input field, enter the tag name\(s\), and click the"Search" button. All images associated with the tag will be shown in the search results. You can also use the [search API](../../api-reference/media-api/list-and-search-files.md).

### Update Image Tags <a id="update-image-tags"></a>

You can update the image tags from the media library or using the [file update API](../../api-reference/media-api/update-file-details.md) as well.

To update a tag to an image in the media library, right-click on the file to open the menu. Click on the "Tags" menu item. This will open a popup, enter the tags you want, and press the "Save" button.
