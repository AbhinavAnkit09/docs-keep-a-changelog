# Upload file API

ImageKit.io allows you to upload a file \(image and non-image\) via API. Based on your requirement, you can either:

1. [Upload file from server](server-side-file-upload.md) using private API key-based authentication, or
2. [Upload file from client-side](client-side-file-upload.md) \(in Javascript, or Android or iPhone app\) using signature-based authentication.

Both methods use the same endpoint, but there is a slight change in the request bodies.
