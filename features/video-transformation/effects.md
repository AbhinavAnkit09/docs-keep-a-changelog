# Advanced video effects

You can create the following effects in the video.

## Progress bar (e-progressbar)

You can show the video's progress when the video is played inline with this dynamic progress bar indicator.

Usage - `e-progressbar-t_<type>-w_<stroke_width>-c_<color>`

* `type` can be either `horizontal` or `frame`. Deault value is `horizontal`.
* `stroke_width` should be an integer. Default value of `stroke_width` is `10px`.
* `color` should be a valid RGB Hex Code. Default value is black.

## Deshake (e-deshake)

This will attempt to fix small changes in horizontal and/or vertical shift. This helps remove camera shake from hand-holding a camera, bumping a tripod, moving on a vehicle, etc.

Usage - `e-deshake`
