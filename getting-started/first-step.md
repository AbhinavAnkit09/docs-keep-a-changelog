# First step

Whether you are serving a few hundred, or a few billion images, you can easily integrate ImageKit.io in the existing infrastructure. Let's learn how to get started quickly.

## Step 1: Create an account

If you haven't yet signed up, [create a free account](https://imagekit.io/registration?planType=free). ImageKit.io offers a forever free plan with generous limits. If you are just getting started with your website, our free plan has got you covered.

## Step 2: Choose an ImageKit.io ID

ImageKit.io ID is a unique identifier for your account. If you don't opt for a custom domain name, then ImageKit.io ID will become part of your image URLs. It should be alphanumeric.

## Step 3: Choose a processing region

Apart from a global CDN, ImageKit.io has its core-processing servers running in multiple locations across the world to reduce the latency between your image storage or server, and ImageKit.io's processing location. Additionally, with built-in automatic failovers, this setup provides higher availability and performance.

After you verify your email, ImageKit.io asks you to choose one of the below processing region:

1. North California \(United States\)
2. North Virginia \(United States\)
3. Frankfurt \(Europe\)
4. Mumbai \(India\)
5. Singapore \(Singapore\)
6. Sydney \(Australia\)

ðŸ§™â™‚ **Tips:** Choosing the right processing region plays a critical role in the response time for first-time image requests. Choose a region which is closest to your origin server location.
