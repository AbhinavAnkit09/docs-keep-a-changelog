Usually, the following features are required in an upload widget:  
  
✅Upload files using remote URLs.  
✅Let users choose files from Google Drive, Dropbox, Instagram, or Facebook.  
✅Option to record a selfie using the device camera and upload it.  
✅Preview added file.  
✅Customize the upload request parameters like file name, tags, folder path, custom coordinates, private file attribute, etc using a nice interface. 

We have written tutorials on using two popular libraries so that you can pick anyone based on your requirements.

1. **Uppy** - A sleek, modular JavaScript file uploader that integrates seamlessly with any application. It allows users to pick files from local devices, webcam or Drive, Facebook, Instagram, and Dropbox. [Read this tutorial](uppy-upload-widget.md) to implement Uppy with ImageKit.io.
2. **Dropzone.js -** An open-source JS library that provides drag and drop file uploads with image previews. It’s lightweight, doesn’t depend on any other library \(like jQuery\), and is highly customizable. [Read this tutorial](https://blog.imagekit.io/imagekit-io-and-dropzone-js-client-side-drag-and-drop-image-upload-from-imagekit-io-user-fca3049c60fb) to implement Dropzone with ImageKit.io. Please note that this tutorial is using the old API, but you can still follow the steps to use the new API endpoints.
